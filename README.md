# improving-the-tictactoe
A copy of an assignment to make detailed improvements to a classic tic-tac-toe game so that gameplay is functional and uses colors and shapes to indicate turns.


#Roadmap to Future Improvements
Name one or two features you’d like to implement
  I would like to change the appearance of the board to resemble a piece of paper, because when I think of tic-tac-toe, I think of making two lines in each direction on a lined piece of notebook paper.
  
How would you implement those features? Write 2–3 sentences per feature
  Changing the style of the background would require either using an image for a background or constructing it by using the css property that each new item goes on top. The lines would have to fit-to screen. I think the image would be easier and could also be within the page instead of take up the whole view port.
  Changing the style of the lines might require some scouring of bootstrap, if they have that style. Otherwise, stylizing the lines between rows and columns could resemble pencil by adjusting the transparency.
  The X's and O's could simply be changed to resemble handwriting by finding a font that is more similar to handwriting.
  An animation could play if there is a winner that could add a mark going through the winning tiles to show which ones were the winner’s streak (I always found this to be the most satisfying part).
